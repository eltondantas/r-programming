###1. Test the Law of Large Numbers for N random normally distributed numbers with mean = 0 and sd = 1:
  - Create an R script that will count how many of these numbers fall between -1 and 1 and divide by the total quantity of N;
  - You know that E(X) = 68.2;
  - Check that mean(Xn) -> E(X) as you rerun your script while increasing N.
  
```{r}
lawLargeNum = function(n){
  count = 0
  for(i in rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)){
    if(-1 < i & i < 1){
      count = count+1
    }
  }
  count/n * 100
}

lawLargeNum(10)
lawLargeNum(100)
lawLargeNum(1000)
lawLargeNum(10000)
lawLargeNum(100000)
```
